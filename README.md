# Regression
In this notebook, the aim was to solve regression problem and understand the concepts of under/overfitting and regularisation.
Diabetes dataset was used to perform regression  https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~boos/var.select/diabetes.html
The code demonstrates application of forward function, calculation of mean squared error, updation of bias and weights, experminetation with different learning rates
We experiment using different learning rates
